## What is Axia?

**Axia** *(from the Greek ἀξία — meaning "value" or "worth")* is a curated repository of foundational rulebooks, philosophies, and design systems that guide the disciplines of programming, engineering, architecture, and design. It serves as a living codex for core principles — the timeless truths, structural patterns, and stylistic doctrines that shape good thinking and building.

This is not a grab-bag of tools or trends. **Axia** is about **what endures**:  
- The architectural blueprints behind great systems  
- The philosophical underpinnings of good code  
- The stylistic doctrines behind elegant design  
- The structural reasoning behind resilient engineering  

Whether you're writing software, sketching interfaces, or modeling systems, **Axia** is your anchor — a collection of intellectual north stars to revisit, reference, and refine.

> *"Build not just what works, but what lasts."*
