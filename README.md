### What is Axia?

**Axia** (from the Greek *ἀξία* — "value," "worth") is a repository of the foundational principles that guide thoughtful programming, engineering, and design. It is a reference for the timeless truths and structural patterns that shape resilient and meaningful work.

But let's be honest: I build things at a rate that would require a new repo every day if I kept up the old way. This is my attempt to centralize the chaos—a single place for the half-baked, the half-mad, and the half-finished. If you've ever found yourself with a graveyard of abandoned repos and a head full of questionable ideas, welcome home.

This is not a collection of fleeting trends. Axia is a guide to what **endures, inspires, questions, and rearranges**. Its purpose is:

-   **To Distill** the architectural blueprints that persist through changing fashions.
-   **To Explore** the philosophical underpinnings that inspire elegant systems.
-   **To Question** the assumptions that limit our thinking and provoke better design.
-   **To Rearrange** chaos into clarity with resilient, universal patterns.

It's also where I document the frameworks, diagrams, and half-mad scribbles that keep me up at night. If you've ever woken up at 3 a.m. to scrawl down a new law of software thermodynamics, you're in the right place. If you've ever thought, "I should make a repo for this," but then realized you already have 200, you're _really_ in the right place.

> *"Build not just what works, but what lasts. Build to inspire, to question, and to rearrange.
> (And if the building never stops, at least organize the blueprints.)"*

### Contents

Axia is organized by its core domains of inquiry.

-   [`programming/`](programming/) — Paradigms, best practices, and language-agnostic insights.
    -   [`Coders-Guide-to-'Good'.md`](programming/Coders-Guide-to-'Good'.md) — A comprehensive framework for timeless software craftsmanship with 10 fundamental tenets and actionable guidelines.
-   [`engineering/`](engineering/) — Systems thinking, architecture, and resilience patterns.
    -   [`SineScramble.md`](engineering/SineScramble.md) & [`sinescramble/`](engineering/sinescramble/) — A multi-mode symmetric cipher combining sine-wave-based permutation and substitution with dual security/performance modes.
    -   [`SineShift.md`](engineering/SineShift.md) & [`sineshift/`](engineering/sineshift/) — A framework for deterministic data permutation via sine-wave-based scrambling with three-column signal processing architecture.
    -   [`Licensee.md`](engineering/Licensee.md) & [`licensee/`](engineering/licensee/) — A multi-layered framework for secure software license key generation using RSA-3072 signatures and SineShift permutation.
    -   [`Instamaster.md`](engineering/Instamaster.md) & [`instamaster/`](engineering/instamaster/) — A signal-centric automated mastering pipeline with corrective EQ, multiband compression, and brickwall limiting.
-   [`architecture/`](architecture/) — Schemas, design systems, and aesthetic principles.
    -   [`gdiff.md`](architecture/gdiff.md) — An opcodeized git diff specification providing machine-readable, granular file change representation beyond traditional line-based diffs.
    -   [`Reverse-Publickey-Identity-Verification[RPIV].md`](architecture/Reverse-Publickey-Identity-Verification[RPIV].md) — A protocol for inverted asymmetric identity where private keys are public identifiers and authenticity is established through decryption.

Each section contains canonical writings, distilled principles, personal notes, and the occasional fever-dream diagram that arrived uninvited. And, inevitably, a pile of "what if I just..." ideas that probably should have stayed in the drafts folder.

### Contributing

Axia grows slowly and deliberately. Contributions are welcome, especially those that represent enduring wisdom over momentary cleverness. If you are also haunted by the need to catalog the principles you uncover, you will fit right in.

To propose an addition:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Add your entry to the relevant directory.
3.  Submit a pull request with a clear rationale. Existential rants are welcome but not required.

### On The Name

The name **Axia** comes from the Greek *ἀξία*, meaning **value** or **worth**. It reflects the repository's mission: to preserve what is essential, not just what is new.

Besides, "The Repository Of Things That Won't Stop Pouring Out Of My Brain" was too long.  
And "Centralized Dumping Ground For The Endless Crap I Think Of" didn't look as good on a resume.
