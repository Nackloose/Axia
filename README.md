### What is Axia?

**Axia** (from the Greek *ἀξία* — "value," "worth") is a repository of the foundational principles that guide thoughtful programming, engineering, and design. It is a reference for the timeless truths and structural patterns that shape resilient and meaningful work.

> *"A principle untested is just a well-dressed guess."*

But let's be honest: I build things at a rate that would require a new repo every day if I kept up the old way. This is my attempt to centralize the chaos—a single place for the half-baked, the half-mad, and the half-finished. If you've ever found yourself with a graveyard of abandoned repos and a head full of questionable ideas, welcome home.

> *"The best ideas arrive at 3 a.m., disguised as nonsense and wearing mismatched socks."*

This is not a collection of fleeting trends. Axia is a guide to what **endures, inspires, questions, and rearranges**. Its purpose is:

-   **To Distill** the architectural blueprints that persist through changing fashions.
-   **To Explore** the philosophical underpinnings that inspire elegant systems.
-   **To Question** the assumptions that limit our thinking and provoke better design.
-   **To Rearrange** chaos into clarity with resilient, universal patterns.

It's also where I document the frameworks, diagrams, and half-mad scribbles that keep me up at night. If you've ever woken up at 3 a.m. to scrawl down a new law of software thermodynamics, you're in the right place. If you've ever thought, "I should make a repo for this," but then realized you already have 200, you're _really_ in the right place.

> *"Build not just what works, but what lasts. Build to inspire, to question, and to rearrange.
> (And if the building never stops, at least organize the blueprints.)"*
>
> *"Every architecture diagram is just a treasure map for future confusion."*

## What is Inkspill?

> A loose collection of drafts, notes, fragments, and half-formed thoughts — the messy beginnings before ideas become Axia.
>
> *"Inkspill: where the muse trips, spills coffee, and leaves a cryptic note in the margins."*

**Inkspill** is the scratchpad, the journal, the floor scattered with pages. It's where ideas arrive in raw form — unpolished, unfiltered, and in-progress.

This is not a place for polish or permanence. It's where:
- Fragments are dropped before they're connected
- Drafts are written without fear of being right
- Thoughts are captured before they're lost
- Notes, experiments, and sketches live freely

> *"Some notes are just future footnotes to a story you haven't written yet."*

Some of these spills will evolve into structured truths. Some won't. That's the point.

## Relationship Between Axia and Inkspill

If **Axia** is the canon — the distilled and enduring truths —  
**Inkspill** is the creative chaos that comes before.

Ideas are spilled here, sifted, then (sometimes) shaped into something worthy of lasting value.

> *"Everything sharp was once a blur."*
>
> *"Before the code compiles, it dreams."*

    -   [`react-mono.md`](inkspill/react-mono.md) — React monorepo architecture and patterns
    -   [`notes/`](inkspill/notes/) — raw thoughts, outlines, observations, and experimental fragments

> *"Folders are just boxes for ideas that refuse to sit still."*

Naming and structure in `inkspill/` may be inconsistent — and that's fine.

Each section contains canonical writings, distilled principles, personal notes, and the occasional fever-dream diagram that arrived uninvited. And, inevitably, a pile of "what if I just..." ideas that probably should have stayed in the drafts folder.

> *"Beware the folder labeled 'misc' — it is the Bermuda Triangle of thought."*

### Contributing

Axia grows slowly and deliberately. Contributions are welcome, especially those that represent enduring wisdom over momentary cleverness. If you are also haunted by the need to catalog the principles you uncover, you will fit right in.

> *"Pull requests are just love letters to the future maintainers."*

To propose an addition:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Add your entry to the relevant directory (`inkspill/` for raw material, or the main domains for more polished work).
3.  Submit a pull request with a clear rationale. Existential rants are welcome but not required.

If contributing to `inkspill/`, embrace the mess. Leave room for contradictions and unfinished thoughts. Think of it as a **shared notebook**, not a published paper.

> *"If you find a typo, it's probably a new word trying to be born."*

Copyright unless stated otherwise until I have time to deal with this

### On The Name

The name **Axia** comes from the Greek *ἀξία*, meaning **value** or **worth**. It reflects the repository's mission: to preserve what is essential, not just what is new.

Besides, "The Repository Of Things That Won't Stop Pouring Out Of My Brain" was too long.  
And "Centralized Dumping Ground For The Endless Crap I Think Of" didn't look as good on a resume.

> *"Naming things is hard. Naming everything is impossible. Welcome to Axia."*

**Inkspill** is exactly what it sounds like: the mess before the meaning, the blur before the sharpness, the place where everything starts but nothing has to finish.

> *"Every masterpiece begins as a mess. Sometimes it stays that way, and that's beautiful too."*
