# Inkspill

> A loose collection of drafts, notes, fragments, and half-formed thoughts — the messy beginnings before ideas become Axia, and the primordial soup from which new paradigms may emerge.

## What is Inkspill?

**Inkspill** is the scratchpad, the journal, the floor scattered with pages. It's where ideas arrive in raw form — unpolished, unfiltered, and in-progress. It is the breeding ground for the next wave of concepts that may one day alter the axioms themselves.

This is not a place for polish or permanence. It's where:
- Fragments are dropped before they're connected
- Drafts are written without fear of being right
- Thoughts are captured before they're lost
- Notes, experiments, and sketches live freely
- Paradigm-shifting seeds are sown, waiting to be cultivated

Some of these spills will evolve into structured truths or even new paradigms. Some won't. That's the point.

## Contents

Current structure:

- `notes/` — raw thoughts, outlines, observations  
- `assembly-tracer.md` — full technical writeup: Assembly Tracer, a real-time application performance analysis system with micro-pool architecture and Bungee Wrapping trampoline features
- `assembly-tracer.spec.md` — detailed technical specification for Assembly Tracer implementation
- `blake3-genetics.md` — exploration of Blake3 hash function genetic algorithms
- `fft_compression_concept.md` — FFT-based compression concept exploration
- `react-mono.md` — React monorepo architecture rulebook and best practices for cross-platform native React deployables

_Naming and structure may be inconsistent — and that's fine. Some files are full documents, others are fragments or living drafts. Folders are for ongoing categories; files at the top level are often larger experiments or reference works in progress._

## Contributing

This repo is intentionally chaotic. If contributing, embrace the mess. Leave room for contradictions and unfinished thoughts.

Think of it as a **shared notebook**, not a published paper.

## Relationship to Perturbarium and Axia

If **Perturbarium** is the container — the controlled environment where ideas can safely perturb and evolve —  
**Axia** is the stable foundation within that container, providing the theoretical bedrock that makes the perturbations meaningful.  
**Inkspill** is the creative chaos and generative ground that comes before, where new paradigms are born and tested.

Ideas are spilled here, sifted, then (sometimes) shaped into something worthy of lasting value in Axia — or even capable of shifting the very foundations of the Perturbarium itself.

## Role in the Perturbarium

Inkspill serves as the creative chaos layer within the Perturbarium container. It is where the most volatile perturbations begin — raw, unfiltered, and unconstrained. This is the space where ideas can be truly experimental, where failure is not just acceptable but expected, and where the next paradigm-shifting concept might be scribbled in the margins. From this creative chaos, ideas can evolve through the structured layers of the Perturbarium, eventually becoming the stable foundations of Axia or the practical implementations that demonstrate the container's value.
