# 📖 Guides

> *"The best code is the code that teaches you something new every time you read it."*

This directory contains paradigms, best practices, and language-agnostic insights that have stood the test of time and continue to guide thoughtful development within the Perturbarium.

## 📋 Navigation

- **[`Coders-Guide-to-'Good'.md`](Coders-Guide-to-'Good'.md)** — A comprehensive framework for timeless software craftsmanship with 10 fundamental tenets and actionable guidelines.

## 🎯 Purpose

These guides represent distilled wisdom — principles that have proven their value across multiple projects, languages, and paradigms. They are not quick tips or trendy practices, but foundational insights that continue to serve developers regardless of the current technological landscape. Within the Perturbarium, they provide the practical wisdom that bridges theory and implementation.

## 💡 Contributing

When contributing to guides, focus on principles that:
- Have proven their value across multiple contexts
- Transcend specific technologies or frameworks
- Provide actionable insights for developers
- Challenge assumptions and provoke better thinking
- Help stabilize the Perturbarium by providing practical wisdom

> *"A good guide doesn't just tell you what to do — it helps you understand why, and when, and how to adapt the principle to new situations."*

## 🏗️ Role in the Perturbarium

Guides serve as the practical wisdom layer within the Perturbarium container. While Axia provides the theoretical bedrock and Inkspill allows for creative exploration, guides offer the distilled experience that helps developers navigate the space between theory and practice. They represent the accumulated wisdom that makes the container not just a place for ideas, but a practical resource for building better software.

> *"Theory without practice is sterile. Practice without theory is blind. Guides bridge the gap."*
