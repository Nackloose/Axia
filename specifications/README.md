# 📋 Specifications

> *"A specification is a contract between the present and the future — it tells you not just what something does, but what it promises to always do."*

This directory contains detailed technical specifications for systems, algorithms, and architectural patterns. These documents serve as the blueprint for implementations and provide the theoretical foundation for complex systems.

## 📋 Navigation

- **[`SineScramble.md`](SineScramble.md)** — A multi-mode symmetric cipher combining sine-wave-based permutation and substitution with dual security/performance modes.
- **[`SineShift.md`](SineShift.md)** — A framework for deterministic data permutation via sine-wave-based scrambling with three-column signal processing architecture.
- **[`Licensee.md`](Licensee.md)** — A multi-layered framework for secure software license key generation using RSA-3072 signatures and SineShift permutation.
- **[`Instamaster.md`](Instamaster.md)** — A signal-centric automated mastering pipeline with corrective EQ, multiband compression, and brickwall limiting.

## 🎯 Purpose

These specifications represent the bridge between theory and implementation. They provide:
- Detailed algorithmic descriptions
- Security considerations and analysis
- Performance characteristics and trade-offs
- Implementation guidelines and constraints
- Testing and validation requirements
