## A Framework for Artificial Evolution Using Extensible-Output Hash Functions

### Abstract

This paper introduces a novel framework for artificial evolution where the genetic representation of an organism is derived directly from its source data using a cryptographic extensible-output function (XOF). An organism's **genome** is the raw byte output of an XOF hash (e.g., BLAKE3, SHAKE, KangarooTwelve) computed from an initial seed or a parental genome. This approach ensures a large, uniformly distributed genetic space, providing an unbiased foundation for evolutionary processes. We define a set of deterministic evolutionary operators, including asexual reproduction, mutation, and several methods for sexual recombination. A core contribution of this framework is the **Dual Offspring Principle**, wherein every sexual recombination event deterministically produces two distinct, reciprocal children, inherently fostering population growth and genetic diversity. The system's properties make it particularly well-suited for simulating competitive co-evolution, enabling complex dynamics such as arms races and emergent specialization. The framework is phenotype-agnostic, deterministic, and computationally efficient, offering a robust tool for research in artificial life, evolutionary computation, and procedural content generation.

### 1\. Introduction

Evolutionary computation (EC) and artificial life (A-Life) are fields dedicated to creating and studying systems that exhibit properties of living organisms, including adaptation, reproduction, and evolution. A fundamental component of any such system is its genetic representationâ€”the data structure that encodes the traits of an organism. Traditional approaches often rely on hand-crafted data structures, which can introduce biases or limit the potential search space.

This paper proposes a framework that leverages the properties of modern cryptography to establish a robust and impartial genetic foundation. Specifically, we use **extensible-output functions (XOFs)**, a class of hash functions capable of producing a message digest of any arbitrary length. By defining an organism's genome as the direct output of a secure XOF, we gain several key advantages:

1.  **Uniformity:** Cryptographic hashes produce output that is uniformly distributed and pseudorandom. This ensures that every possible genome is equally likely, eliminating structural bias in the initial gene pool.
2.  **Determinism:** Hash functions are deterministic. Given the same input, they always produce the same output, allowing for perfectly replayable evolutionary simulations.
3.  **Efficiency:** Modern XOFs, particularly **BLAKE3**, are highly optimized for speed, enabling the generation and manipulation of large populations at a low computational cost.

Our framework specifies a complete system for generating and evolving these hash-based genomes. We detail operators for reproduction and mutation and introduce the **Dual Offspring Principle** as a novel mechanism for sexual recombination that inherently drives population expansion and competitive dynamics.

### 2\. The Hash-Genome System

The core of the framework is the generation and interpretation of genomes from arbitrary data.

#### 2.1. Genome Generation

An organism's genome, $G$, is a fixed-length byte sequence generated by an XOF, $H$. The process is defined as:
$$G = H(D, L)$$
where:

  - $D$ is the input data, an arbitrary sequence of bytes. For the initial organism (progenitor), $D$ can be any seed, such as text, an image file, or random data. For subsequent generations, $D$ is derived from the parental genome(s).
  - $L$ is the desired length of the genome in bytes (e.g., 256 bytes for a 2048-bit genome).
  - $H$ is a secure XOF. While any XOF is suitable, **BLAKE3** is recommended for its exceptional performance and security characteristics. Other valid choices include SHAKE128/256 and KangarooTwelve.

This resulting digest, $G$, serves as the organism's immutable "origin genome."

#### 2.2. Genome Interpretation (Genotype-Phenotype Mapping)

The framework itself remains agnostic to the meaning of the genome. The interpretation of the genome's bitstream into a tangible **phenotype** (e.g., color, size, behavior) is left to the specific application. A common and effective mapping strategy is to treat the genome as an ordered array of genes.

For a genome of length $L$:

  - **Gene:** A single byte (8 bits) can represent a gene, allowing for $2^8 = 256$ possible alleles.
  - **Chromosome:** A contiguous block of bytes can be designated as a chromosome, grouping related genes. For instance, a 256-byte genome could be divided into 32 chromosomes of 8 bytes each.
  - **Trait Mapping:** Individual genes or combinations of genes are mapped to specific phenotypic traits. For example, in a simulated creature, `genome[0]` might control metabolic rate, `genome[1]` might control primary color, and so on.

The uniform distribution of the hash output ensures that each gene's initial value is statistically independent of the others, creating a fair and unbiased genetic baseline for evolution.

-----

### 3\. Evolutionary Operators

The evolution of genomes is governed by a set of deterministic operators applied to parental genomes.

#### 3.1. Asexual Reproduction

Asexual reproduction is the simplest evolutionary step, where a child is generated from a single parent. We define two distinct forms of asexual reproduction:

**Direct Asexual Reproduction:** A child is generated by re-hashing the parent's genome:
$$G_{child} = H(G_{parent}, L)$$
This process creates a deterministic lineage, forming a Markov chain seeded by the progenitor's genome. Each generation is a step function away from the last, allowing for gradual, path-dependent evolution.

**Asexual Self-Reproduction:** A special case occurs when an organism reproduces with itself, effectively using its own genome as both maternal and paternal contribution. This is implemented by applying sexual recombination operators to identical genomes:
$$G_{child} = H(C(G_{parent}, G_{parent}), L)$$
where $C$ represents any sexual recombination operator (fusion, slicing, or condensation). This produces offspring that are genetically similar to the parent but exhibit variation due to the hash function's properties.

#### 3.2. Mutation

Mutation introduces variation by altering a genome before the reproductive hashing step. This is modeled by applying a bitmask, $M$, to the parent's genome using an XOR operation:
$$G_{mutated} = G_{parent} \oplus M$$
The mutated genome is then hashed to produce the final offspring:
$$G_{child} = H(G_{mutated}, L)$$
The Hamming weight (number of set bits) of the mask $M$ directly controls the mutation rate. This allows for fine-tuned control over the introduction of novelty.

#### 3.3. Sexual Recombination and the Dual Offspring Principle

Sexual recombination combines the genetic material of two parents, $P\_1$ and $P\_2$, to produce offspring. A central innovation of this framework is that all sexual recombination methods are designed to produce **two reciprocal children**, a concept we term the **Dual Offspring Principle**. This naturally doubles the population size with each reproductive event and maximizes genetic diversity by exploring complementary combinations of parental genes.

The following methods can be used to generate an intermediate pre-image, $C$, which is then hashed to produce the final child genome $G = H(C, L)$.

  - **Sexual Fusion (Interlacing):** Bytes from each parent are interleaved. Two reciprocal children are formed by changing the starting parent.

      - $C\_1 = (P\_1[0], P\_2[0], P\_1[1], P\_2[1], \\dots)$
      - $C\_2 = (P\_2[0], P\_1[0], P\_2[1], P\_1[1], \\dots)$

  - **Sexual Slicing (Single-Point Crossover):** Both parent genomes are split at a common point $k$. The segments are then swapped to create two children.

      - $C\_1 = P\_1[0:k] \\ || \\ P\_2[k:L]$
      - $C\_2 = P\_2[0:k] \\ || \\ P\_1[k:L]$ (where $||$ denotes concatenation)

  - **Sexual Condensation (Concatenation):** The full parent genomes are concatenated in opposite orders.

      - $C\_1 = P\_1 \\ || \\ P\_2$
      - $C\_2 = P\_2 \\ || \\ P\_1$

In each case, two distinct genomes, $G\_1 = H(C\_1, L)$ and $G\_2 = H(C\_2, L)$, are produced from a single reproductive event between $P\_1$ and $P\_2$.

#### 3.4. Omni-Reproduction: Comprehensive Genetic Exploration

A powerful extension of the reproductive framework is the concept of **Omni-Reproduction**, which generates a comprehensive "litter" of offspring using every available reproductive method, mutation, and genomic transformation. This approach implements exhaustive genetic exploration by producing offspring through all possible pathways simultaneously.

The `omni_reproduce` function takes two parents and generates offspring through:

1. **Asexual Reproduction:** Direct asexual reproduction from both parents
2. **Asexual Self-Reproduction:** Self-reproduction from both parents (2 children each)
3. **Sexual Reproduction:** Standard sexual recombination between parents (2 children)
4. **Mutated Variants:** Multiple mutated versions of both parents using different mutation masks
5. **Rotated Variants:** Rotated versions of both parents using different rotation positions
6. **Permuted Variants:** Permuted versions of both parents using different permutation maps
7. **Combined Transformations:** Mutated and rotated versions of both parents
8. **Enhanced Sexual Offspring:** Sexual children that are further mutated

This comprehensive approach typically generates 50-100+ offspring from a single reproductive event, providing maximum genetic diversity and exploration of the genetic space. The omni-reproduction mechanism is particularly valuable for:

- **Genetic Diversity Maximization:** Exploring the full spectrum of possible genetic combinations
- **Rapid Evolution:** Accelerating evolutionary progress through exhaustive exploration
- **Research Applications:** Studying the complete genetic landscape around parental genomes
- **Optimization Problems:** Finding optimal solutions through comprehensive search

The omni-reproduction function can be implemented as follows:

```python
def omni_reproduce(self, partner: Organism, 
                  mutation_masks: List[bytes] = None,
                  rotation_positions: List[int] = None,
                  permutation_maps: List[List[int]] = None) -> List[Organism]:
    """Performs comprehensive reproduction between two parents."""
    
    children = []
    
    # 1. Asexual reproduction from both parents
    children.append(self.direct_asexual_reproduction())
    children.append(partner.direct_asexual_reproduction())
    
    # 2. Asexual self-reproduction from both parents
    children.extend(self.asexual_self_reproduction())
    children.extend(partner.asexual_self_reproduction())
    
    # 3. Sexual reproduction between parents
    children.extend(self.reproduce_sexually(partner))
    
    # 4. Mutated versions of both parents
    for mask in mutation_masks:
        children.append(self.mutate(mask))
        children.append(partner.mutate(mask))
    
    # 5. Rotated versions of both parents
    for pos in rotation_positions:
        children.append(self.rotate(pos))
        children.append(partner.rotate(pos))
    
    # 6. Permuted versions of both parents
    for perm_map in permutation_maps:
        children.append(self.permute(perm_map))
        children.append(partner.permute(perm_map))
    
    # 7. Combined transformations
    for mask in mutation_masks[:2]:
        for pos in rotation_positions[:2]:
            mutated = self.mutate(mask)
            children.append(mutated.rotate(pos))
    
    # 8. Enhanced sexual offspring
    sexual_children = self.reproduce_sexually(partner)
    for child in sexual_children:
        for mask in mutation_masks[:2]:
            children.append(child.mutate(mask))
    
    return children
```

This omni-reproduction mechanism represents the most comprehensive approach to genetic exploration within the XOF-Genetics framework, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore the complete genetic landscape around any pair of parental organisms.

#### 3.5. Dual-Encoded Self-Evolving Organisms: Self-Encoding Reproduction Strategies

A revolutionary extension of the framework is **Dual-Encoded Self-Evolving Organisms**, where each organism's genome directly encodes its own reproduction strategy. This eliminates the need for separate meta-genomes and creates a truly integrated evolutionary system where the genome itself determines how the organism reproduces.

In dual-encoded evolution, the organism's genome contains encoded information about:

- **Reproduction Method Flags:** The first byte of the genome encodes which reproductive methods are enabled (8 bits for 8 different methods)
- **Combination Strategy:** The second byte determines how methods are combined ('all', 'random', 'weighted')
- **Mutation Masks:** Subsequent bytes encode custom mutation patterns
- **Rotation Positions:** Bytes encoding rotation parameters
- **Permutation Maps:** Bytes encoding permutation patterns
- **Method Weights:** Bytes encoding probabilistic selection weights

When two dual-encoded organisms reproduce, they combine their reproductive strategies:

1. **Union of Methods:** All reproductive methods enabled in either organism are used
2. **Combined Parameters:** Mutation masks, rotation positions, and permutation maps from both parents are combined
3. **Averaged Weights:** Method selection weights are averaged between parents
4. **Comprehensive Reproduction:** The combined strategy is applied to generate offspring

This approach creates several powerful effects:

- **Massive Reproductive Explosion:** Combining strategies from both parents leads to exponential population growth
- **Natural Strategy Evolution:** Reproduction strategies themselves evolve through the genome
- **Integrated System:** No artificial separation between organism and reproduction strategy
- **Emergent Complexity:** Simple genome encoding creates sophisticated reproductive behaviors

The dual-encoded approach can generate 50-200+ offspring from a single reproductive event, creating massive exploration of the genetic space:

```python
def dual_encoded_reproduce(self, partner: DualEncodedOrganism) -> List[DualEncodedOrganism]:
    """Reproduce using genome-encoded strategies from both organisms."""
    
    # Combine strategies from both organisms
    combined_strategy = self._combine_strategies(partner)
    
    # Use all methods enabled in either organism
    methods_to_use = self._select_methods(combined_strategy)
    
    # Apply each method to generate offspring
    children = []
    for method in methods_to_use:
        method_children = self._apply_reproduction_method(method, partner, combined_strategy)
        children.extend(method_children)
    
    return children
```

This dual-encoded approach represents the most natural and integrated form of evolution within the XOF-Genetics framework, where the genome itself is the complete blueprint for both the organism and its reproductive behavior.

#### 3.6. Meta-Evolution: Evolving Reproduction Strategies

Building on the genome-driven concept, **Meta-Evolution** allows organisms to evolve not just their genomes, but also their reproduction strategies. This creates a meta-evolutionary system where the best reproductive methods are discovered through evolution itself.

In meta-evolution, organisms carry a **meta-genome** that encodes:

- **Reproduction Method Selection:** Which reproductive methods to use
- **Method Parameters:** Custom mutation masks, rotation positions, permutation maps
- **Combination Strategies:** How to combine different reproductive methods
- **Selection Weights:** Probabilistic weights for method selection

The meta-genome evolves alongside the regular genome, creating a meta-evolutionary arms race where:

- **Strategy Competition:** Different reproductive strategies compete for effectiveness
- **Adaptive Evolution:** Organisms evolve better ways to reproduce
- **Emergent Strategies:** Complex reproductive behaviors emerge from simple rules
- **Meta-Learning:** The system learns optimal reproductive methods through evolution

Meta-evolution typically shows:

- **Strategy Convergence:** Populations converge on effective reproductive strategies
- **Diversity Maintenance:** Multiple strategies coexist in balanced populations
- **Performance Improvement:** Meta-evolution often outperforms regular evolution
- **Strategy Innovation:** Novel reproductive methods emerge through evolution

#### 3.7. Genomic Transformations

These operators act as "gene filters" that can modify a genome's structure prior to reproduction or mutation.

  - **Rotation (Circular Shift):** The genome is rotated left or right by $n$ positions. This shifts the gene-to-trait mapping without altering the genetic content itself. $G' = \\text{rotate}(G, n)$.
  - **Permutation:** The positions of bytes within the genome are shuffled according to a predefined permutation map, $\\pi$. This radically alters gene linkages while preserving all original alleles. $G' = \\text{permute}(G, \\pi)$.

### 4\. System Dynamics and Applications

The architectural choices of this framework give rise to powerful evolutionary dynamics.

#### 4.1. Implications of the Dual Offspring Principle

The mandatory generation of two children per sexual reproduction event has profound consequences:

  - **Population Growth:** It creates a natural potential for exponential population growth ($2^n$), establishing a baseline pressure for survival.
  - **Inherent Competition:** As the population expands, organisms must compete for limited resources or survival opportunities, making selection a natural consequence of reproduction.
  - **Automatic Diversity:** Reciprocal children often express complementary or opposing traits, automatically injecting a broad spectrum of strategies into the gene pool.

#### 4.2. Applications in Competitive Co-evolution

The framework is exceptionally well-suited for modeling **competitive co-evolution**, where organisms evolve in response to each other. The dual offspring system naturally fuels an "arms race" dynamic.

  - **Arena Combat:** In simulated combat scenarios, each generation produces twice the number of combatants, creating natural tournament brackets where only the victors reproduce.
  - **Resource Competition:** In environments with finite resources (e.g., energy, space), the expanding population creates intense selective pressure for efficiency and territorial control.
  - **Novelty Generation:** The constant pressure to outcompete rivals drives the evolution of novel survival strategies. The system's ability to explore both conservative (asexual) and radical (sexual) genetic changes allows for rapid adaptation.

#### 4.3. Intergenerational Tournament Selection

A novel selection mechanism that leverages the Dual Offspring Principle is the **Intergenerational Tournament**, which creates direct competitive dynamics between parents and their offspring:

1. **Child Pair Generation:** Two parents produce a pair of reciprocal children through sexual recombination.
2. **Sibling Combat:** The two children compete against each other in a fitness-based contest. The winner becomes the "champion child."
3. **Parent-Child Challenge:** The champion child then challenges both parents in individual contests.
4. **Elimination Protocol:** If the champion child defeats either parent, that parent is eliminated from the population. Parents that survive their challenges remain in the population.

This mechanism has several compelling properties:

- **Generational Pressure:** It creates explicit pressure for offspring to outperform their parents, driving rapid evolutionary improvement.
- **Population Control:** The elimination of defeated parents provides natural population management without arbitrary culling mechanisms.
- **Elite Preservation:** Strong parents can persist across multiple generations, maintaining valuable genetic material while still being vulnerable to superior offspring.
- **Adaptive Selection:** The tournament directly tests fitness in the specific domain, ensuring that selection pressure aligns with the desired evolutionary objectives.

The Intergenerational Tournament can be implemented as follows:

```python
def intergenerational_tournament(parent1: Organism, parent2: Organism, fitness_func):
    """Conducts an intergenerational tournament between parents and their offspring."""
    
    # Generate child pair
    children = parent1.reproduce_sexually(parent2)
    child1, child2 = children[0], children[1]
    
    # Evaluate fitness for all participants
    parent1.fitness = fitness_func(parent1)
    parent2.fitness = fitness_func(parent2)
    child1.fitness = fitness_func(child1)
    child2.fitness = fitness_func(child2)
    
    # Sibling combat - determine champion child
    champion_child = child1 if child1.fitness > child2.fitness else child2
    
    # Parent-child challenges
    parent1_survives = parent1.fitness > champion_child.fitness
    parent2_survives = parent2.fitness > champion_child.fitness
    
    # Return survivors
    survivors = []
    if parent1_survives:
        survivors.append(parent1)
    if parent2_survives:
        survivors.append(parent2)
    survivors.append(champion_child)
    
    return survivors
```

This tournament mechanism can be integrated into the main evolutionary loop, where each reproductive event triggers an intergenerational tournament, and the survivors form the basis for the next generation's reproductive pool.

#### 4.4. Post-Tournament Pairing Mechanisms

After completing all intergenerational tournaments, the surviving organisms must be paired for the next round of reproduction. Several pairing strategies can be employed to create parent pairs from the gene pool:

**Random Pairing:** Organisms are randomly shuffled and paired sequentially. This approach maintains maximum genetic diversity and prevents premature convergence.

**Rank-Based Pairing:** Organisms are sorted by fitness and paired according to specific strategies:
- **Elite vs Elite:** Highest fitness organisms are paired with each other, promoting the preservation of strong genetic combinations.
- **Elite vs Challenger:** Highest fitness organisms are paired with lower fitness organisms, creating opportunities for genetic rescue and diversity maintenance.
- **Complementary Pairing:** High fitness organisms are paired with low fitness organisms in a structured manner (e.g., 1st with last, 2nd with second-to-last).

**Tournament-Based Pairing:** Organisms compete in mini-tournaments to determine pairing order, with winners being paired together.

**Handling Odd Numbers:** When an odd number of organisms survive the tournament rounds, the unpaired organism undergoes **asexual self-reproduction**:

```python
def asexual_self_reproduction(organism: Organism):
    """Performs asexual reproduction using the organism's own genome as both parents."""
    # Use the organism's genome as both maternal and paternal contribution
    maternal_genome = organism.genome
    paternal_genome = organism.genome
    
    # Apply sexual recombination operators using identical genomes
    # This will produce two children with slight variations due to the hash function
    children = sexual_recombination(maternal_genome, paternal_genome)
    return children
```

This self-reproduction mechanism ensures that valuable genetic material is not lost while maintaining the dual offspring principle. The resulting children will be genetically similar to the parent but will exhibit some variation due to the deterministic but pseudorandom nature of the hash function.

#### 4.5. Fitness Evaluation and Selection

The evolution engine is phenotype-agnostic; it merely provides the genetic substrate. The user must define a **fitness function** that evaluates an organism's phenotype and assigns a score. The evolutionary loop follows a standard pattern:

1.  Generate an initial population.
2.  Evaluate the fitness of each organism based on a domain-specific task (e.g., combat effectiveness, resource gathering).
3.  Select the highest-fitness organisms to become parents.
4.  Generate a new population via the reproductive operators.
5.  Repeat the cycle.

When using the Intergenerational Tournament selection mechanism, the loop is modified to:

1.  Generate an initial population.
2.  Evaluate the fitness of each organism.
3.  Select parent pairs for reproduction using a pairing strategy (random, rank-based, or tournament-based).
4.  For each parent pair, conduct an intergenerational tournament.
5.  Collect all survivors from all tournaments to form the next generation.
6.  If the number of survivors is odd, the unpaired organism undergoes asexual self-reproduction.
7.  Repeat the cycle.

### 5\. Properties of the Framework

#### 5.1. Determinism and Replayability

A key scientific advantage of this framework is its perfect replayability. Since the XOF hash function and all evolutionary operators are deterministic, an entire evolutionary history can be perfectly reconstructed given:

  - The initial seed data.
  - The sequence of operators applied (reproduction methods, mutation masks, etc.).

This allows for rigorous analysis, debugging, and verification of emergent phenomena.

#### 5.2. Implementation Considerations

  - **Data Types:** Genomes should be handled as raw `bytes` or `bytearray` objects for maximum efficiency. Conversion to hexadecimal strings should only be done for visualization or storage.
  - **Performance:** The use of a highly optimized library for the chosen XOF (e.g., the official `blake3` Python package) is critical for high-throughput simulations.
  - **Population Management:** Given the potential for exponential growth, implementations must include a culling mechanism (e.g., tournament selection, resource-based death) to maintain a manageable population size.

A complete implementation is available in the `implementations/xof-genetics/` directory, providing all the functionality described in this paper along with comprehensive demonstrations and documentation.

### 6\. Conclusion

We have presented a framework for artificial evolution that uses cryptographic XOFs to generate and manipulate organismal genomes. This hash-based approach provides a secure, unbiased, and computationally efficient foundation for evolutionary systems. Its key featuresâ€”including deterministic replayability and the novel **Dual Offspring Principle**â€”make it a powerful tool for studying competitive co-evolution and generating emergent complexity. Future work will involve applying this framework to specific problem domains, such as procedural content generation for video games, generative art, and optimization problems, as well as exploring the dynamics produced by different XOFs and recombination strategies.
