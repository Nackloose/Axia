# 🧠 Theory

> *"Theory is the foundation upon which all practical knowledge is built. Without it, we're just guessing."*

This directory contains theoretical foundations, schemas, design systems, and aesthetic principles that form the intellectual bedrock of the systems and algorithms implemented throughout Axia.

## 📋 Navigation

- **[`gdiff.md`](gdiff.md)** — An opcodeized git diff specification providing machine-readable, granular file change representation beyond traditional line-based diffs.
- **[`Reverse-Publickey-Identity-Verification[RPIV].md`](Reverse-Publickey-Identity-Verification[RPIV].md)** — A protocol for inverted asymmetric identity where private keys are public identifiers and authenticity is established through decryption.
- **[`xof-genetics.md`](xof-genetics.md)** — Genetic algorithms using cryptographic hash functions for evolutionary computation.

## 🎯 Purpose

These theoretical papers explore:
- Novel approaches to established problems
- Fundamental principles that transcend specific implementations
- Mathematical foundations for complex systems
- Design patterns that can be applied across domains
- Philosophical frameworks for understanding computation
