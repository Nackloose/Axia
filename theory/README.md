# 🧠 Theory

> *"Theory is the foundation upon which all practical knowledge is built. Without it, we're just guessing."*

This directory contains theoretical foundations, schemas, design systems, and aesthetic principles that form the intellectual bedrock of the systems and algorithms implemented throughout the Perturbarium. These represent the mathematical frameworks that give structure to the perturbations cultivated in the container.

## 📋 Navigation

- **[`gdiff.md`](gdiff.md)** — An opcodeized git diff specification providing machine-readable, granular file change representation beyond traditional line-based diffs.
- **[`Reverse-Publickey-Identity-Verification[RPIV].md`](Reverse-Publickey-Identity-Verification[RPIV].md)** — A protocol for inverted asymmetric identity where private keys are public identifiers and authenticity is established through decryption.
- **[`xof-genetics.md`](xof-genetics.md)** — Genetic algorithms using cryptographic hash functions for evolutionary computation.

## 🎯 Purpose

These theoretical papers explore:
- Novel approaches to established problems
- Fundamental principles that transcend specific implementations
- Mathematical foundations for complex systems
- Design patterns that can be applied across domains
- Philosophical frameworks for understanding computation
- Structured perturbations that can be systematically studied and applied

## 🏗️ Role in the Perturbarium

Theory serves as the mathematical framework layer within the Perturbarium container. It provides the structured perturbations that bridge the foundational axioms of Axia with the practical specifications and implementations. Theory represents the systematic exploration of ideas, where raw concepts from Inkspill are refined into mathematical frameworks that can be rigorously studied, tested, and applied. It is where the creative chaos of the container begins to take on structured, meaningful form.

> *"Theory is where we learn to dance with the perturbations, finding the patterns in the chaos and the order in the disorder."*
