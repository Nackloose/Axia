"""
SineScramble: A Multi-Mode Symmetric Cipher

A novel symmetric encryption algorithm that combines sine-wave-based 
permutation and substitution, supporting both high-security Multi-Round Mode
and high-performance Segmented Mode.

Three implementations are available:
- Turbo: âš¡ RECOMMENDED for high-performance, large data, and streaming (default)
- Original: Best for Multi-Round (high-security) mode and as a reference
- Optimized: For experimental JIT research only

Version: 2.1.0
Author: N Lisowski
