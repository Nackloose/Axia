This report contains the results of formal security analysis using Tamarin Prover.

ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
================

Core Security Properties:
- Confidentiality: [TO BE FILLED]
- Integrity: [TO BE FILLED]
- Correctness: [TO BE FILLED]

Attack Resistance:
- Known-Plaintext Attack (KPA): [TO BE FILLED]
- Chosen-Plaintext Attack (CPA): [TO BE FILLED]
- Differential Cryptanalysis: [TO BE FILLED]
- Linear Cryptanalysis: [TO BE FILLED]

Side-Channel Resistance:
- Timing Attacks: [TO BE FILLED]
- Power Analysis: [TO BE FILLED]

Advanced Attack Resistance:
- Meet-in-the-Middle (MITM): [TO BE FILLED]
- Slide Attacks: [TO BE FILLED]
- Algebraic Attacks: [TO BE FILLED]

Cryptographic Properties:
- Key Space: [TO BE FILLED]
- Parameter Independence: [TO BE FILLED]
- Avalanche Effect: [TO BE FILLED]

RECOMMENDATIONS:
===============

1. Review any failed proofs and understand the counterexamples
2. Consider strengthening the model for failed properties
3. Implement additional security measures for weak points
4. Conduct empirical testing to complement formal analysis

LIMITATIONS:
============

1. Symbolic analysis may miss implementation-specific issues
2. Model abstraction may not capture all real-world scenarios
3. Computational limits may prevent analysis of complex properties
4. Results should be used alongside other security analysis methods
