# 🔧 Implementations

> *"Code is the ultimate truth-teller. It doesn't care about your theories or your intentions — it only cares about what works."*

This directory contains working implementations of the theoretical concepts and specifications defined throughout Axia. These are complete, runnable systems that demonstrate the practical application of the ideas explored in the theory and specification documents.

## 🎯 Purpose

These implementations serve as:
- Proof of concept for theoretical ideas
- Reference implementations for specifications
- Working examples for learning and experimentation
- Foundation for further development and research
- Validation of design decisions and trade-offs

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
Most implementations require Python 3.8+ and can be set up with:
```bash
cd implementations/[project]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Examples
```bash
# Cipher demo
cd sinescramble && python demo.py

# Audio mastering
cd instamaster && python instamaster.py

# License generation
cd licensee && python keygen_ui.py

# Permutation analysis
cd sineshift && ./run.sh

# Genetic algorithm
cd xof-genetics && python -m xof_genetics.demo
```
